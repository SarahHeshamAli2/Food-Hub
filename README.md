# Food Hub üçΩÔ∏è

A modern recipe sharing platform built with **React + Vite** and **Clerk** authentication, featuring role-based access, per-user favorites, and a clean, modular UI. This project is designed for learning, portfolio, and as a solid foundation for real-world recipe or content-sharing apps.

---

## Features

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Clerk integration** for secure user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out).
- **Role-based access**:
  - Only one admin (by Clerk user ID, set in `.env`).
  - All other users are "members".
- **Protected routes** for admin and user pages, with proper loading and redirect UX.

### üç≤ Recipes
- **Browse all recipes** with images, cuisine, and meal type.
- **Add new recipes** (pending admin approval).
- **Admin-only user management** (placeholder for future features).

### ‚≠ê Favorites System
- **Per-user favorites**: Each user can add or remove recipes from their favorites.
- **Favorites stored in backend** (`db.json`/`json-server`), not in Clerk metadata.
- **Favorites page**: View your own favorite recipes, dynamically loaded.
- **Heart icon** on recipe list for quick add/remove.

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Routing & UI
- **ProtectedRoute** components for both admin and user roles.
- **Loading spinners** and clean redirects for a smooth experience.
- **Modular, maintainable code**: All UI logic separated into presentational and container components, with CSS modules for styling.
